<h3>The story</h3>
<p>
Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
They said,<q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</q></strong>
The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
<q class="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,
<q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</q></strong>
</p>

<p>
The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
The neighbors then said,<q class="villagers"> dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>"</span></q>
and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</q></strong>
The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
Again all the neighbors came around and said,<q class="villagers">Isn’t that great?</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</q></strong>
    
   <blockquote>whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span>"</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span>"</span> — 
because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good </span></span>fortune.</blockquote>

    <tr style="background-color: grey;">
        <td>Lose a horse</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>

        <tr style="background-color:white;">
        <td>Win more horses</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>

        <tr style="background-color: grey;">
        <td>Son injury</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>

        <tr style="background-color: white;">

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p><span class="good">good</span> and <span class="bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas.
Let's not make a big deal out of it...
