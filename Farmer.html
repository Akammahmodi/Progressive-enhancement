<h3>The story</h3>
<p>
Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
They said,<q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
The farmer said, <q><strong>Maybe.</q></strong>
The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
<q< class="villagers"></q>>Oh, isn’t that lucky.
What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,
<q><strong>Maybe.</q></strong>
</p>

<p>
The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
The neighbors then said,<q class="villagers"> dear, that’s too bad, </q>
and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong>
The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
Again all the neighbors came around and said,<q class="villagers">Isn’t that great?</q> Again, he said, <q class="villagers"><strong>Maybe.</q></strong>
    
   <blockquote style="color: rgb(105, 26, 26) ;">"The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — 
because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune."</blockquote>

<p>Here is this dialog in the form of a table:</p>
<table border="6">
    <tr style="background-color: grey;">
        <th style="background-color: white;">Event</th>
        <th style="background-color: white;"><span style="color:green;">good</span> or <span style="color:red">bad</span></th>
    </tr>

    <tr style="background-color: grey;">
        <td>Lose a horse</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>

        <tr style="background-color:white;">
        <td>Win more horses</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>

        <tr style="background-color: grey;">
        <td>Son injury</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>

        <tr style="background-color: white;">
        <td>Avoid war</td>
        <td>Maybe</td>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas.
Let's not make a big deal out of it...
